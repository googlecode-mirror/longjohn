PHP based media center for personal video, music and photos.

I started making this as a way to publish my personal videos, music and photos on a website. I wanted to be able watch my movies, and listen to my music at work without needing to pack around my mp3 player.

The video center is designed to support Divx video and allow for databasing and categorizing video libraries and providing streaming links.

The audio center allows for creating customized play lists using the database and generates custom m3u files on the fly for streaming music, primarily mp3 audio.

The photo album creator as a way to quickly share pictures. It generates thumbnails and creates photo albums.

If you are interested in joining email kevinbatchelor@gmail.com. If you want to download the php, the zip file in the download section provides the full working project.

To install it:
-First install xampp
-Second copy the longjohn folder to the htdocs directory of xampp
-When you visit the long john index page you will be directed to create a new database.
-From there follow the on screen instructions.

Note about the php. I'm not a real developer. I just threw this together and it is not in anyway compliant with any standards of quality or certifications.
